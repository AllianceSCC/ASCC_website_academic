## Support for: Writing 

(Including: graduate program applications, job application packets, manuscripts, dissertations, & more)

### Editing:		

* Structure/Content --- Early in the writing/brainstorming process and need help with deciding what should be included, the organization of an early draft, or can't _quite_ put your finger on what's missing? Structure and content editing comes in at the beginning of your writing process. We can help you brainstorm or outline that early draft before it exists and then edit your writing to identify missing information or help with the overall organization. **Use content and structure editing to ensure concise writing with all the information your readers need, and nothing they don't.**

* Copy editing	--- In the late stages of writing and need fresh eyes to check for grammar and typos? Copy editing gets you a fresh pair of eyes to make sure that each paragraph looks, and reads, its best. **Use copyediting to drop your wordcount and catch those mistakes that will distract the reader from your writing.**

* Formatting --- Got a finished product that reads just how you want but doesn't look how they want it to? Use our formatting services to put your words in their specified format

### Data analysis & visualization:

* Reproducible data analysis --- Need help analyzing that data and/or making the right graphics? Let us help by creating an easy to use and repeatable method of cleaning and visualizing your data.

## Support for: Grants		

### Editing: 
* Structure/Content ---  Use content and structure editing to ensure concise writing with all the information your readers need, and nothing they don't.

* Copy editing --- Use copy editing to drop your word count and catch those mistakes that will distract the reader from your writing.


### Consulting:		
* Research	summary (~2k words)	--- Interested in expanding your research into a new direction but need a handle on the literature? Use our research summary services to dig through the literature and write a brief (~2,000 word) summary of the field. [Not for use in published manuscripts without prior agreements]

* Outreach	--- Many grants now require sections detailing how you plan to engage the broader community with your research. Use our consulting services to come up with a plan that works for you.

* Inclusive Research Design & Analysis --- Let us help ensure that your research can draw robust conclusions about the broadest population(s) possible.

* Reproducible Research --- Let us help you convert your data analysis and manuscript writing process into straight-forward, collaborative workflows to improve repeatable data cleaning, analysis and visualization that can be easily shared and documented.
