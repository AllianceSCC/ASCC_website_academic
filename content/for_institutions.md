## Workshops:	


* "Telling Your Science as a Story" --- A two hour workshop to learn the basics of adapting narrative storytelling to your scientific story. By the end, participants will have learned the And/But/Therefore (ABT) narrative structure and identified the most compelling story line for their science.

* "Being an Academic Ally" --- From thesis committees to faculty hiring committees, learn how to identify and respond to common biases and altered expectations for marginalized groups. Attendees will learn concrete actions to support and champion trainees and peers from marginalized groups.

* Reproducible Science --- Workshops for investigators and trainees to convert their data analysis and manuscript writing processes into straight-forward, collaborative workflows. Attendees will learn about tools that can improve repeatable data cleaning, analysis, and visualization while allowing easy sharing and documentation.

* Intro to R/Git/Unix --- Workshops to introduce investigators and trainees to programming skills for data analysis. Based off of the [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) training program and taught by a Carpentries-certified instructor.

## Consulting:	


* Digital writing hours for graduate students & postdocs --- Make an experienced science communicator available to your trainees to help with their manuscripts, presentations, grant proposals, job applications, and scicomm efforts. 

* Demographic collection & report (current or historical) --- Need to know your program's demographics and trainee outcomes? We can help collect demographic information from current and previous trainees, while also identifying their career outcomes. The data can be supplied alone, or along with a full analysis and report. We can also help institutions, programs, and departments prepare for diversity programs and grants like the AAAS SEA Change program.

**Need help with a problem not listed?** Let us know! We are equipped to tackle most higher ed projects that require data analysis, multicultural competency, and/or communications expertise.
