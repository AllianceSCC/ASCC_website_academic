## Consulting:	
* Outreach	--- Many grants now require sections detailing how you plan to engage the broader community with your research. Use our consulting services to come up with a plan that works for you.

* Inclusive Research Design & Analysis --- Let us help ensure that your research can draw robust conclusions about the broadest population(s) possible.

* Demographic collection & report (current or historical) --- Need to know your program's demographics and trainee outcomes? We can help collect demographic information from current and previous trainees, while also identifying their career outcomes. The data can be supplied alone, or along with a full analysis and report. We can also help institutions, programs, and departments prepare for diversity programs and grants like the AAAS SEA Change program.

**Need help with a problem not listed?** Let us know! We are equipped to tackle most higher ed projects that require data analysis, multicultural competency, and/or communications expertise.
