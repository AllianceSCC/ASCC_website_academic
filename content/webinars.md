## Workshops & Webinars:	

* "How to Write a Review Paper" --- A one hour workshop to break down the intimidating project of a review paper into manageable pieces. Participants will learn tools to facilitate their writing process and to revise a first draft for their advisor.

* "Telling Your Science as a Story" --- A two hour workshop to learn the basics of adapting narrative storytelling to your scientific story. By the end, participants will have learned the And/But/Therefore (ABT) narrative structure and identified the most compelling story line for their science.

* Reproducible Science --- Workshops for investigators and trainees to convert their data analysis and manuscript writing processes into straight-forward, collaborative workflows. Attendees will learn about tools that can improve repeatable data cleaning, analysis, and visualization while allowing easy sharing and documentation.

* Intro to R/Git/Unix --- Workshops to introduce investigators and trainees to programming skills for data analysis. Based off of the [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) training program and taught by a Carpentries-certified instructor.
